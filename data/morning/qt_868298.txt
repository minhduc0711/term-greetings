I was real skinny in high school. I was real fast and explosive. I just didn't really have a good nutrition plan; I didn't understand how important it was to be healthy. I was eating hot fries, potato chips in the morning, Capri Sun. That was like my breakfast. That changed when I got to college - I put on 20 pounds of muscle. - Antonio Brown
