I'm so stupid because I refuse to think that I'm getting older. I get up in the morning, and it's like, 'La, la, la, I'm so pretty.' I still mingle with a lot with young people. I even go to college campuses to talk to them because I know how they think. They don't think I'm boring, either. They think I'm cool, but I want them to think I'm hot! - Charo
